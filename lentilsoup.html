<div id="favourite">
<br>This is my favorite Lentil soup.
  <br>It's very simple, and I've cobbled it together by trying some other recipes, and then well, leaving stuff out.
  <br>It is very, very simple, but it is also one of my favorite foods ever. Here are the ingredients:</p>

<div id="Ingredients">
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 Carrot, chopped</li>

<li>1 Onion, chopped</li>

<li>1 Stalk celery, chopped</li>

<li>1/2 pound of green lentils</li>

<li>1 28 oz can of whole tomatoes</li>

<li>28 oz cold water</li>

<li>2 bay leaves</li>

<li>tiny pinch of cumin (maybe 1/8 of a tsp)</li>

<li>tiny pinch of ground thyme (again, like, 1/8 of a tsp)</li>

<li>1 tbsp of vinegar</li>
</div>

<div id="Instructions">
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<p>Simple to do. Sweat the veggies over low heat with a little kosher salt. When the onion is translucent, add lentils and stir. Cook them with the veggies for a couple minutes. Add tomatoes, water, cumin, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil. Simmer covered for 1 hour to 1 1/2 hour. Add the vinegar and thyme, cook for another minute or two. Add salt to taste.</p>

<br>I like my lentil soup this way, without too many herbs or any chicken broth. Recipes that call for those things are nice enough, but I like the brightness and mild acidity the soup has this way. I think it complements the earthy flavor of the lentils and the mirepoix.

<h2>Important reminders and tips:</h2>
<ul>
- Wash your lentils. And I did find a stone once, so keep an eye out.

- I like to use red wine vinegar in this, but I have used apple cider vinegar in a pinch, and I'm sure other vinegars could be fun. I mean, not white distilled of course. That stuff is for cleaning the coffee pot and disinfecting the cutting board, IMHO.

- Salt is key. I just made a batch of this and had to adjust the salt a couple times. The flavor is subtle so you need to use enough to bring it out, but if you use to much you'll overpower it. When I eat alone, I add salt in the bowl until it tastes about right. I think Kosher salt may do a noticeably better job here. Thanks to Carlo who got me paying more attention to my salt after a conversation we had awhile ago.
